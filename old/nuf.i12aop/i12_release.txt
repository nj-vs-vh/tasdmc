*** nuf.i12 release notes ***


=== i12 modifications compared to i10 ===

1. Fit
 1.1. AGASA eta formula is used without a cut below 62.7 degrees
      Above 62.7 updated formula is used (obtained by fiteta of good events)
 1.2 fix_site() recalculates tower based on triggered SD's (needed
      for Ben's MC to have the same tower definition as in data)
 1.3 zero detectors for data no longer use AliveDet, using detector
      lists and DeadDet
 1.4 zero detectors are now filled in within distance from largest
      detector, not from core


=== compatibility notes ===
    a. if you compile with GSL<=1.10 (e.g. on icrr server)
       please replace gsl_multimin_fminimizer_nmsimplex2 with
       gsl_multimin_fminimizer_nmsimplex in src/fit.cpp (one
       occurrence)
    b. wiki result is obtained by running the program
       on pass2 files by Rutgers sdanalysis v2.4
