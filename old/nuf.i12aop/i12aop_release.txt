*** nuf.i12aop release notes ***


=== i12aop modifications compared to i12 ===

    a. Added linear fit of Area/Peak
    b. 2 output columns added to SDDB:
       	 AOP at 1200m
	 AOP slope (linear coefficient)

TODO: 
      AOP is non-linear, there are often a feature
      near 1200 m. 
      ST idea to add interpolation of AOP to 1200m
      using neighbouring points
