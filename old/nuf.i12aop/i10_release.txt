*** nuf.i10 release notes ***

=== compatibility notes ===
    a. if you compile with GSL<=1.10 (e.g. on icrr server)
       please replace gsl_multimin_fminimizer_nmsimplex2 with
       gsl_multimin_fminimizer_nmsimplex in src/fit.cpp (one
       occurrence)
    b. wiki result is obtained by running the program
       on pass2 files by Rutgers sdanalysis v2.4

=== i10 modifications compared to i8 ===

1. Fit
 1.1. Removed saturate_mc()
 1.2. Saturated counters now excluded from LDF fit
 1.3. bugfix: even close to the core rusdgeom_.igsd[sd]==0 detectors
     should be excluded from both timing and LDF fit
 1.4. theta>90 fix, if(mytheta>90) mytheta = 180 - mytheta;
      affects only inclined events (usually not a case for theta<60)
 1.5. Linsley error may not be smaller than at r=150 meters
 1.6. -geom option refits geometry after joint fit (require ndet>=5)
 1.7. DAQ error used to exclude bad detectors, ex. -d=090913 -t=203852
      (this should be eventually fixed in Rutgers reconstruction)
 1.8  Fixed fiteta bug, now variable fit is consistent
 1.9  If detector has a waveform in tasdcalibev never treat as zero
	 (some detectors are lost is Rutgers reconstruction
	  found by Okuda-san, example: 090201-162702 SD#0517)

2. Interface
 2.1. Added timing waveform plot (like plot from Taketa-san's event display)
 2.2. Added peak/asymmetry output
 2.3. -geom option
 2.3. -sign option and DBSIG output (signal information)
      features: peak count within signal not implemented
	        integral covers two bins below threshold at the end
		some waveforms start with 1,2,3 bin GAP
 2.4. CIC+CORSIKA energy formula is now used for output
 2.5. CIC+COSMOS energy formula available with -cosm option
      For energy formulas please see:
